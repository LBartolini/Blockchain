# Blockchain

This is only a project to understand better whats behind Bitcoin's network and Blockchain.
If you find something in the code that isn't really realistic, Don't panic please!
I just made some adjustments to the Theory of BITCOIN so that it is easier to me to understand the whole process.
So this is just my version of it, without a peer-to-peer network and the consensus protocol. 
I will be using a centralized model( i know that this is the farest thing from the Bitcoin I could ever imagine).
